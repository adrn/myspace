## projects
- Find smooth position-dependent distortions of the velocity field that sharpen velocity-space structure locally. Interpret those smooth distortions dynamically.
- Classify stars in velocity-space structures into those participating in resonances and those in more localized kinematic clusters.
- Find smooth position-dependent distortions of the velocity field that make chemical abundances most strongly predictive of velocity. Interpret *that*.
