## projects
- Find smooth position-dependent distortions of the velocity field that sharpen
  velocity-space structure locally. Interpret those smooth distortions
  dynamically.
- Classify stars in velocity-space structures into those participating in
  resonances and those in more localized kinematic clusters.
- Find smooth position-dependent distortions of the velocity field that make
  chemical abundances most strongly predictive of velocity. Interpret *that*.
